				<p>My first interaction with coding came by way of <span class="tags">Myspace</span> in the mid 2000's. I really didn't know much about coding, but I would copy and paste templates and then dig through the code and adjust different things to see if they would do what I wanted them to do on my profile. I spent the next several years working normal jobs and hating it, until one day, I decided if I wanted to <span class="tags">break free</span> from a traditional career, I needed to do something <span class="tags">different</span> than I was doing. </p>
					<p>So, in 2013 I enrolled in <span class="tags">Treehouse</span>, an online code school. I took a short break to focus on planning my wedding, and then I started a more in-depth code bootcamp through <span class="tags">CareerFoundry</span>. During that course, I learned mostly <span class="tags">HTML, CSS, and Javascript</span>. I also worked with Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Ajax, Angular, caching strategy, JQuery, Git, Heroku, and frameworks such as Bootstrap. </p>
						<p>Since then, I have been doing freelance work and building my portfolio up. If you have any questions about my journey or would like to know more about me, be sure to drop a line in my contact section. I'd love to <a href="index.html#contact-anchor"><span class="tags">chat!</span></a></p>
